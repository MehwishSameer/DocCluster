# K-mean-Clustering
This project focuses on document clustering using the K-Means algorithm. The objective is to cluster a given dataset and evaluate the results using the external measure of Purity. The Purity metric is calculated by determining the most common class within each cluster and summing the counts, then dividing by the total number of documents.
