# K-mean-Clustering
This project performs document clustering using TF-IDF-weighted Word2Vec and evaluates the clustering results. It includes preprocessing steps, feature engineering, TF-IDF clustering, TF-IDF weighted Word2Vec representation, Doc2Vec extension, dimensionality reduction using PCA, and K-Means clustering. The code also provides evaluation metrics such as purity and silhouette score.
